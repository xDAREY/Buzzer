# buzzer

A flutter project with multiple widgets.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
It consists of widgets like NavigationDrawer, IconButton, UserAccount Widget etc.
The purpose of creating this project is to increase my experience with flutter and make certain features available for my next project or for anyone who needs it.
I will be adding the floatingMenu widget also, almost making it a complete application that just needs to be utilized for a speicific purpose.
